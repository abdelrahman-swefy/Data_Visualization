# Prosper Loan Exploration



## Dataset

> There are 113,937 loans in this dataset with 81 features. I focused on the borrower rate and what characteristics affect the borrower's rate.
From the 81 features I have selected 6 characteristics which are Loan Original Amount, Monthly Loan Payment, Employment Status, Employment Status Duration, Prosper Rating and Term.
And as I stated befor the main feature of interest is the borrower's rate.

## Summary of Findings

> For the main feature of interest, I have found that the Borrower's Rate is inversely proportional with the Loan Original Amount and Monthly Loan Payment, But what
was more interesting for me is that the Loan term does not have huge impact on the Borrower's Rate. Also surprisingly The propser rating have a huge effect on the Borrower's rate, As moving 
from the higher rate to the lower rate the Borrower's rate increases. Also an interesting outcome that the changing in Employment status does not effect the Borrower's Rate whether it is 
Employed , Self Employed, Full time, part time, etc except for the unemployed applicant which have higher borrower's rate.

> For Other Features, We can see obviously the directly proportional relation between the Original Loan Amount and the Monthly Loan Payment. Also by investingating the counts of different 
categoricals variables we can see that the Prosper Rating loans of Full time Applicant do not change by far from AA to C in contrast to the rest of Status which we can see that the majorty
of Loans are form C, Also A quite interesting result is that the majoity of 60 Months Loan Term are from Employed Applicant. Also From the distribution of Employment Status we can see that
the Monthly Loan Payment does not change by changing status which is surprisingly as the unemployed applicant is supposed to pay less than the rest of applicants.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I have focused on the characteristics on the features which have impact on the main features (the Borrower's Rate) like the Original Loan Amount, and the Monthly
Loan Payment. Also I have stated the Term as I surprised that it does not have an impact on the Borrower's rate/
> Also I have showed the surprising relation between different characteristic like Original Amount by Prosper Rating and Term, and Borrower's Rate by Prosper Rating and term.
